//easier to make one static connection and open it for many users, versus opening many static connections, one for each user
//e.g. if have program for playing jackblack, you have many classes that do different functions that involve a deck of cards, you would only have one static class for a deck of cards, instead of making a deck of cards for each of the class functions
//statics fill up your memory
